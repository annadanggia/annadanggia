I am **ANNADANGGIA**, a dedicated blockchain validator based in Southeast Asia. With over three years of experience, I specialize in supporting blockchain projects from their devnet and testnet stages through to mainnet deployment. My extensive experience ensures that I can effectively contribute to the success of these projects by deploying and maintaining blockchain networks to the highest standards.

**Professional Experience**

Throughout my career, I have been actively involved in numerous testnet projects, including Avail, Tangle, Dymension, Autonity, Nwaku, Warden, Side, Alignedlayer, Tanssi, Initia, and currently, 0g Labs. My participation in these projects has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the various challenges and requirements at each stage of blockchain development.

**Technical Infrastructure**

To support my work, I maintain a robust and stable server system featuring:

- Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6342 CPUs, with 48 cores and 72M Cache at 2.8 GHz
- 256GB RAM
- 8TB NVMe SSD storage
This powerful setup ensures high performance and reliability, essential for maintaining blockchain networks and validating transactions efficiently.

**Contributions and Vision**

My goal is to leverage my expertise and technical resources to contribute significantly to the projects I work on, ensuring their overall success and stability. I am committed to delivering optimal performance and security, which are critical factors for the successful deployment and operation of blockchain networks.

By combining my experience, technical skills, and robust infrastructure, I aim to support and enhance the development and deployment processes of blockchain projects, ensuring their seamless transition from testnet to mainnet. I look forward to bringing my capabilities to new projects and contributing to their success in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.
